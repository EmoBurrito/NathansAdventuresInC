Why mount my drive when I can mount someone else's drive?

## For COSC292
This is a simple repository I set up for two reasons:

1. To serve as a remote repository. I used to run my workspaces directly on a flash drive so that way I always had all my notes, source files, etc. with me wherever I was be it in class, at home, or wherever. I still store my notes on a drive.
2. To have my code public in case someone else needs it. I'm definetly not a C genius or really for any language. I'm a young adult with two years post secondary education, but little field experience. I don't have any code in this repository that you cannot find in textbooks, tutorials, or online.

Remember, Rob only teaches even numbered courses.
